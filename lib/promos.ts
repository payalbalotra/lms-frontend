 * filter and delete `PROMO_SLUGS` — every caller already goes through this
 * helper, so the swap is a one-line change.
 *
 * Order is the display order on the home page (most prominent first). Add a
 * slug here only when the corresponding procedure has been seeded in
 * `SEED_PROCEDURES` (or will arrive via the backend).
