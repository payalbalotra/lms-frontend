/**
 * The next step once the home says someone is overdue: nudge them, in one tap.
 *
 * There is no notification service yet, so a tap only marks the button sent
 * for the session. When the backend can text or notify, the call goes in
 * `onSend`; the button and its wording stay as they are.
 *
 * Controlled, because the same person's button shows twice -- on the row and
 * in their drawer -- and a tap in one has to show in the other. Text only,
 * like the other row actions (Send again, Open, Continue).
