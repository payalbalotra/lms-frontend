/**
 * A radial meter: one ratio against its whole, drawn as an arc on a track of the
 * same ramp a step lighter.
 *
 * Not a donut. A two-slice donut is a chart of one number pretending to be a
 * comparison; a meter says "this much of that" and reads at 44px. It appears only
 * where both halves are real — 5 published of 7, 5 joined of 7 — and never where
 * a number would have to be invented to fill it.
 *
 * The ring is decoration over text that already states the same thing, so it is
 * hidden from assistive tech and the tile's own words carry the meaning.
