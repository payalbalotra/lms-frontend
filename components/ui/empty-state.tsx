/**
 * A place where something will be, and is not yet.
 *
 * Nineteen files drew this by hand — the same dashed card, at five different
 * paddings, with the heading at 14px in some and 16px in others, and the icon
 * sometimes in a circle and sometimes not. It is one thing, so it is one
 * component.
 *
 * Two jobs, and the difference matters: nothing has been made yet (`action` is
 * the way to make the first one), or nothing matched (`action` clears the
 * filter). Both read the same, because from the reader's side both are an empty
 * list with one way out.
 *
 * Dashed, because a solid card claims the space is finished. The dashes say the
 * shape is real and the contents are not here yet.
