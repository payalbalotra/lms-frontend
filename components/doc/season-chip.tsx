/**
 * SeasonChip — the small pill that says which season(s) a recipe belongs to.
 *
 * Renders nothing for an empty list (non-recipes). When both `summer` and
 * `winter` are picked, the chip collapses them into a single "Summer & Winter"
 * label rather than two stacked pills. The tone reuses the brand-tint palette
 * already documented in DESIGN.md §3 so we don't add a new colour.
 *
 * Used by:
 *  - the cook view `DocBar` (right slot, see `procedure-view-client.tsx`)
 *  - the admin facts block (`procedure-article-body.tsx`)
 *  - the procedure row on every list (`procedure-row.tsx`)
 *
 * The component is presentational only — the active-season filter lives in
 * `lib/api.ts:canRead`. Switching active seasons here would change the chip's
 * label, not its visibility.
